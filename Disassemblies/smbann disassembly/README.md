# Super Mario Bros All Night Nippon Disassembly

This disassembly is based off of Doppelganger's fantastic work with the SMB 2J diassembly: https://www.romhacking.net/documents/653/

In the source there are a series of ".ifdef ANN"'s, which show the parts that are added, moved and removed between ANN and SMB2j.

## Building

Use assemble.bat to assemble the ROM. Unfortunately, it is not assemble-able right now.

Enjoy!
