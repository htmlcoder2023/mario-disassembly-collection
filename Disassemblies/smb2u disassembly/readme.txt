build -dREV_A

And to assemble Super Mario Bros 2 (PRG0), write this on the command line:

Note: PRG0 has a game-breaking glitch regarding Fryguys. If Mario or another character shrinks at the same moment a mushroom block hits a Fryguy, the Fryguy is flipped upside down and the game mistakenly thinks that Mario has not defeated every Fryguy, and so it does not allow the exit door to spawn. Unfortunately, because Super Mario Bros. 2 does not have Time Limit, Mario is stuck in the level forever and must reset. 

Another issue with PRG0 is that on PAL consoles (or PAL region set on emulators), the Bonus Chance does not render correctly.
